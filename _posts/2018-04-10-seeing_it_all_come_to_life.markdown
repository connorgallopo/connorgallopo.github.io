Up until this point it was cool, i could make some CLI apps and if i really wanted to i could make a Gem that would be accessible to anyone. But up until this point I didn’t truly understand how it all applied.

I have worked in a QA position for about 2 years now. I got to interact with a rails application that was built from the ground up internally. Conceptually I never quite understood how it all worked though. I had no concept of HTTP requests and I had never even heard of MVC before.

I've started to learn that this curriculum starts you all the way at basics (rack) and steps you all the way through giving you both the conceptual understanding of how the tools we use in every day web development work behind the scenes and at the same time building immediately applicable skills.

So now that i'm all the way through Sinatra everything seems to have clicked again. I can look at the rails application that I use day-to-day and have a good understanding of it. And beyond this comes an even greater understanding of rails itself. This being something that I’ve looked forward to for a very long time.

So here I am again, with the same buzz that I was on after finishing my last project. Eager to move forward and learn whats ahead!
