// For as long as I can remember traditional education has always been a struggle for me. It seemed like what might have come naturally to my peers required considerably more effort and dedication from me to achieve similar results. Despite that challenge, I made it to a well-known college in Philadelphia.

Freshman year was a big change. I met great people and had a lot of fun, but my grades were less than ideal. It wasn’t until sophomore year that I realized something had to change, so I left school and returned home. I used this time home to work and really focus on growing myself. After about a year, I went back to the same school. In one semester I raised my GPA substantially, but when it came time to choose classes for the next year I realized that school just wasn’t right for me and I decided to withdraw from the university.

At that point in my life I was 19 years old, working Apple retail and living in the family home in Philadelphia. I knew that if I was going to keep moving forward, I had to find something more than a job . I was looking for a career with opportunities for growth, both within the organization and for myself as a person. That’s when I found Power Home Remodeling Group.
When I was referred to Power I had no idea what was ahead of me. I was walking into a what I thought was a small sales organization that did home remodeling. After the first interview I found myself eager for the next, and soon enough I was in an entry level sales position and as clueless as ever on where to go next.

Months went by, and during that time I learned to work harder than I ever had in my life. It felt like I was finally starting to make some traction. My Regional Vice President at the time understood my passion for technology and told me that I should look into the Business Technology department. I knew nothing about the department, but I quickly learned that it was one of the most progressive and innovative departments within the company (and the industry). I knew it was something I needed to be a part of.

I set my sights on a position in Business Technology. Connections were made, goals were met, and soon I became a member of that team. Not long after, I made the connection with one of our newer developers, Garett Arrowood. He had recently graduated from Flatiron, and he introduced me to Ruby and the learn.co prep course. I was hooked.

It took me nearly a year and a half to find the time to explore everything the free course had to offer. What surprised me most was the way the curriculum changed my outlook on education. For so long it felt like I was spinning my wheels, going through classes to learn a skill, and quickly moving onto the next without having the opportunity to apply it. This is where the software development world differed; I was learning skills and instantly applying them. It was a hands on education that allowed me to immediately apply each new concept to yield results that I could be proud of.

After competing the prep course I knew that Flatiron was the education for me and it would put me on a path that I was proud to be on. I ended up receiving a scholarship, which I was very grateful for, but I still had a couple things to figure out prior to enrolling. Most of my time was already filled because of my involvement with Power, so I knew it would be difficult to work in education on top of that. I ended up meeting with our CIO about the opportunity, and from there it turned into something I could realistically imagine.

From a conversation that was just intended to inform our CIO of how I was going to spend my extra time (such as lunch breaks, and my life outside Power) came something totally different. With the help of Garett, we created a mentorship program . He was someone within Power that would be there to support and help me grow professionally within the company and the curriculum. From there it has only snowballed, creating opportunity within Power for not only Garett and myself but for others with a passion for development as well.

So when somebody asks me “Why did you want to become a Developer?” the conversation starts with my technical background, but it ends with the incredible organization I am a part of. I’m constantly inspired by the support from Power and my peers, and grateful for the opportunity that can be created from within.//
